Who's Erin Smith?
</h2>
<p>
Hello, My name is Erin Smith, I am a 12th grader at Westside Academy Highschool, I am 16 years old. I really want to be comfortable when I get older (2-4 years from now), by comfortable I mean I want to not have to worry about if I have enough money for the movies,rent, and food, I want to have enough for all that and extra to save up.
</p>
<p>My Philosophy <a href="https://www.footlocker.com/?SID=8793&inceptor=1&cm_mmc=paid%20search-_-google-_-g-_-branded-_--_--_-p-_--_--_-11011814-_--_-291586454-_-textads-_-p31072680863-_-313562981699-_--_--_--_-&gclid=CjwKCAjw67XpBRBqEiwA5RCocRHzS9CE1zCrTkw7H-22_TMcK9RcOwg4xylxCjeIaOoQKA2BEpeo3RoCy2oQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Foot Locker</a> is to always GROW , I feel that nothing should never be able to bring you down or stop you from keeping your focus on life or your MONEY (Grind). I think a way people can always keep focus is by stop listening to what everyone have to say to you.
