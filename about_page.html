<ul>
<p>
<li>
<b>Hello</b>, My name is Erin Smith, I am a 12th grader at Westside Academy Highschool, I am 16 years old. I really want to be comfortable when I get older (2-4 years from now), by comfortable I mean I want to not have to worry about if I have enough money for the movies,rent, and food, I want to have enough for all that and extra to save up.
</li>
</p>
<li>
<p>My Philosophy is to always <b>GROW</b> , I feel that nothing should never be able to bring you down or stop you from keeping your focus on life or your <b>MONEY</b> (Grind). I think a way people can always keep focus is by stop listening to what everyone have to say to you.
</li>
</p>
<p>
    <li>
If you want a balanced and complete organization you can depend on me because I am a <b>Great Leader,</b> I can learn things really fast and teach them faster and if someone needs help in detail i am there for that too. I also am very <b>Dependable</b>, You can count on me with your life if you needed to.
</li>
