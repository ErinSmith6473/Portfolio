Who's Erin Smith?
</h1>

<p>
Hello, My name is Erin Smith, I am a 12th grader at Westside Academy Highschool, I am 16 years old. I really want to be comfortable when I get older (2-4 years from now), by comfortable I mean I want to not have to worry about if I have enough money for the movies,rent, and food, I want to have enough for all that and extra to save up.

My Philosophy is to always GROW , I feel that nothing should never be able to bring you down or stop you from keeping your focus on life or your MONEY (Grind). I think a way people can always keep focus is by stop listening to what everyone have to say to you.

If you want a balanced and complete organization you can depend on me because I am a Great leader, I can learn things really fast and teach them faster and if someone needs help in detail i am there for that too. I also am very dependable, You can count on me with your life if you needed to
